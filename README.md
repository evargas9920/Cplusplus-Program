Airgead Banking App

This project was a fun learning experience. I picked this upload to show how I can solve the basic issues. Here I created some columns and computations. This code is a great starting point, I can add as many new features as imaginable. When considering a comapny 's Core Code for a program, it should be secure and robust. This banking app is a very stable form. Much can definately be improved upon, this being one of my first attempts at C++ programming, I am thus far satisfied.
